# Chinese Historical RPF: Computational Analysis of Political Allegory and Narrative Reimagination
This repository contains code, data, and analysis for the study **"From Metaphor to Literal Romance: Computational Analysis of Political Allegory and Narrative Reimagination in Chinese Historical RPF"**, investigating how traditional Chinese political allegory is transformed into explicit romantic narratives in digital fan culture.

## 📜 Overview
This interdisciplinary project combines computational methods (network analysis, statistical modeling, LLM-based extraction) with humanistic inquiry to analyze Chinese historical Real Person Fiction (RPF) on Archive of Our Own (AO3). The study examines:
-Structural patterns of romantic reimagination through network analysis
-Narrative dynamics of monarch-official relationships using LLM extraction
-Community practices through qualitative interviews with fan creators
